Hey, it's my first project on GitHub, so keep tracking my profile and i promise there will be more! 

Generally i focus on backend so forgive a weak design.

If you want to start this app you have to:
-Download all repository on your pc
-Download node.js
-In command prompt navigate file where is this repo and type "npm install"
-create file config.json
-Create account here: https://darksky.net/dev/account
-In config write:
{
    "forecastAPI":"your api key from darksky"
}
-than start server by typing command "node server.js"
